# Love2D_3DMaze
A first-person 3D Maze in LÃ¶ve2D, inspired by the ZX Spectrum
Written by Rob Probin, July 2018.

# History
Typically I have a summer holiday (=vacation) project where, although I don't get a lot of time, I try to write something different from my normal stuff. 

This one was inspired by a ZX Spectum BASIC program in a book called "Over the Spectrum" Edited by Philip Williams. The program was called 3D-Mazeman by Beam Software and used pre-calculated lines to form walls/corridors/'doorways'. The turing was 90 rotation, a bit like the original Dungeon Master but with just white walls and black lines.

In fact, due to the Internet Archive I can show you the screen shot out of the book itself: https://archive.org/stream/over-the-spectrum/OverTheSpectrum#page/n23

# Running this
At the moment I'm using ZeroBrane Studio to run this in a copy in Love2d 0.10.1 Super Toast.

At some point I'll provide some more instructions for running it stand-alone.
